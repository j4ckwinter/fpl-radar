Implement **Engine v1.1 – Step 1: Keep bench status in data but remove it from ranking**.

## Context
Right now, the SELL scoring ranks players partly based on whether they are benched (`pickPosition > 11`). This is noisy because a player may be benched for reasons like a difficult fixture or rotation, so we want to:
- keep `isBenched` in the returned features (for debugging / future use),
- but **stop using it to affect sellScore** (and any pre-ranking).

This task should be a small, safe change.

---

## Scope
- Update SELL scoring only (Issue #13 implementation).
- Do NOT change candidate generation legality (Issue #12).
- Do NOT change BUY scoring (Issue #14).
- Do NOT add any new endpoints or DB schema.

---

## Deliverables

### A) Remove bench weighting from sell scoring
Find the SELL scoring constants and logic:
- `src/prediction/sellScoring/constants.ts`
- `src/prediction/sellScoring/score.ts`

Make these changes:
1) Remove (or set to 0) the bench-related weight:
   - `SELL_SCORE.BENCHED`
2) Remove the condition that adds bench weight to `sellScore`:
   - do not add points when `isBenched === true`

### B) Keep bench info in features
Do NOT remove `isBenched` from:
- `SellCandidateScore.features`
- `extractSellFeatures(...)`

We still want it visible in output.

### C) Update reasons
In `score.ts`, ensure bench-related reasons are not added.
Remove:
- "On the bench" reason (or any bench-derived reason strings)

### D) Update any tests
If you have unit tests for sell scoring:
- update expectations so bench status no longer changes score
- bench should still appear in features output

If there are no tests yet:
- add a minimal vitest test file:
  - `src/prediction/sellScoring/score.test.ts`
  - test that:
    - a benched player and a starting player with identical other features produce the same `sellScore`
    - both include correct `isBenched` feature

Keep the test small and deterministic. You can mock the player fields and bypass DB by testing a pure helper if one exists. If `scoreSellCandidates` is DB-bound, create a small pure scoring function like:
```ts
export function computeSellScoreFromFeatures(features: SellCandidateScore["features"]): { score: number; reasons: string[] }
```

Acceptance Criteria

- sellScore no longer changes based on bench status

- isBenched still appears in features

- No bench-related reason appears in output

- Tests (if added/updated) pass

Implementation Order

- Update constants + scoring logic

- Update reasons

- Add/update unit tests

- Run tests and ensure no other scoring changed
