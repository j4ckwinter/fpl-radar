You are working in the repo `fpl-radar`.

Implement Issue #11: Fetch and store entry transfer history (public endpoint) and derive a lightweight behaviour profile per entry.

This builds on:
- Issue #7: `FplClient` exists and has HTTP/caching/Zod patterns
- Issue #8: reference tables exist
- Issue #9: league + league entries persisted
- Issue #10: entry snapshots/picks persisted (optional dependency, but useful)

## Goal
For each entry (manager) in a league:
1) Fetch their transfer history via public FPL API
2) Persist raw transfer events (structured, queryable)
3) Derive and store a simple `behaviour profile` used later in rival transfer prediction (risk appetite etc.)

The pipeline must:
- handle many entries efficiently with a concurrency limit
- be idempotent (no duplicate transfers)
- tolerate partial failures (continue if an entry fails)
- be runnable via a script now and reusable by a worker later

Do NOT implement prediction logic yet.

## FPL endpoints required
Public transfers endpoint:
- `GET /api/entry/{entryId}/transfers/`

This returns an array of transfer records. Typical fields include:
- `element_in`, `element_out` (player ids)
- `event` (gameweek)
- `time` (timestamp)
- `value`, `bank` (ints in tenths)
- `cost` (hit cost for that transfer batch; may be repeated)
- `points` / `points_on_bench` sometimes appear depending on season

Treat upstream fields defensively. Validate only what you need.

## Deliverables

### A) Prisma schema changes
Add models:

#### 1) `FplEntryTransfer`
Represents a single recorded transfer action for an entry.
Fields:
- `id` String @id @default(cuid())
- `entryId` Int
- `eventId` Int
- `time` DateTime
- `playerInId` Int
- `playerOutId` Int
- `value` Int?        (team value after transfer, tenths)
- `bank` Int?         (bank after transfer, tenths)
- `cost` Int?         (hit cost associated, if present)
- `createdAt` DateTime @default(now())

Constraints:
- Unique composite to prevent duplicates:
  - `(entryId, eventId, time, playerInId, playerOutId)`
Indexes:
- `(entryId, eventId)`
- `(playerInId)`
- `(playerOutId)`

Foreign keys:
- `entryId` → `FplLeagueEntry.id` (or keep scalar if relation is awkward)
- `eventId` → `FplGameweek.id`
- `playerInId/playerOutId` → `FplPlayer.id`

#### 2) `FplEntryBehaviourProfile`
Derived stats used for later prediction weighting.
Fields:
- `entryId` Int @id
- `transfersCount` Int
- `hitsCount` Int                 (number of times cost > 0)
- `totalHitCost` Int              (sum of costs)
- `avgTransfersPerGw` Float
- `hitRate` Float                 (hitsCount / number of active GWs with transfers)
- `lastTransferAt` DateTime?
- `updatedAt` DateTime @updatedAt

Optional extra (nice but not required):
- `earlyTransferRate` Float (transfers made >24h before deadline vs late; only if deadlines available)

Run migration:
```bash
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name fpl_entry_transfers
