You are working in the repo `fpl-radar`.

Implement Issue #9: Ingest classic Fantasy Premier League league standings by league ID and persist them to Postgres.

This builds on:
- The existing `FplClient.getLeagueStandings(...)`
- Prisma models created in Issue #8
- The ingestion pattern established for bootstrap-static

## Goal
Create an ingestion pipeline that:
- Fetches all entries in a classic league (handles pagination)
- Persists league metadata and league entries
- Is idempotent and safe to re-run
- Can be executed via a script and later reused by a worker job

This step should NOT fetch picks or transfers yet — standings only.

## Domain Concepts (important)
- A **League** represents a mini-league (classic league).
- A **LeagueEntry** represents a manager/team within that league.
- Standings change over time, but entry identity is stable (entry ID).
- We only care about the *current* standings for now (no historical snapshots yet).

---

## Deliverables

### A) Prisma schema changes

Extend `prisma/schema.prisma` with:

#### 1) `FplLeague`
- `id` Int @id (league ID from FPL)
- `name` String
- `createdAt` DateTime @default(now())
- `updatedAt` DateTime @updatedAt

#### 2) `FplLeagueEntry`
- `id` Int @id (entry ID from FPL)
- `leagueId` Int (FK → FplLeague)
- `entryName` String
- `playerName` String
- `rank` Int
- `lastRank` Int?
- `totalPoints` Int
- `updatedAt` DateTime @updatedAt

Indexes:
- index on `leagueId`
- optional composite index on `(leagueId, rank)`

Relations:
- FplLeague 1 → many FplLeagueEntry

After updating the schema, run:
```bash
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name fpl_league_standings
