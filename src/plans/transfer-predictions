Implement Issue #12: Generate legal 1-transfer candidates per rival (within a league) for a given gameweek, using persisted snapshots/picks and reference data.

This step creates the “candidate generation” layer for the rival transfer prediction engine. It must be correct and explainable. Do NOT implement scoring/probabilities yet (that is Issue #13–#15).

Assume Issue #8–#11 are complete:
- Reference data persisted: players/teams/positions/gameweeks
- League standings persisted
- Entry snapshots + picks persisted for a target `eventId`
- Entry transfers persisted and behaviour profiles exist (optional input, not required here)

---

## Goal
Given:
- `leagueId`
- `entryId` (a rival manager in that league)
- `eventId` (gameweek snapshot)

Generate a set of legal single transfers `OUT -> IN` that the rival could make, subject to constraints:
- Budget constraint (bank + sell value >= buy price)
- Position constraint (OUT and IN same position) for v1 (no formation change modelling)
- Max 3 players per real team
- Can’t bring in a player already owned
- Must produce only valid 15-player squads

Output should include:
- candidate transfers list, each with:
  - outPlayerId
  - inPlayerId
  - estimatedCostDelta (in tenths)
  - resultingBank (tenths)
  - constraint checks (for debugging / later “reasons”)
- diagnostics: how many candidates were generated and why candidates were filtered

This will be used later by scoring/probability steps.

## Important simplifications for v1
- 1 transfer only (no double transfers)
- Same-position swap only
- Use current `nowCost` for buy price
- For sell price:
  - If we have per-entry “purchase price / selling price” from public API we can’t reliably; so v1 use `nowCost` as sell price too.
  - Document this as an approximation in code comments and output field naming (`estimatedSellPrice`).
- Do not model chips, wildcard, free hit
- Do not require knowing “free transfers remaining” (not reliably public)

## Deliverables

### A) Domain types
Create:
- `src/prediction/types.ts`

Define types:
```ts
export interface SquadState {
  entryId: number;
  leagueId: number;
  eventId: number;
  bank: number | null; // tenths
  players: Array<{ playerId: number; teamId: number; positionId: number; nowCost: number }>;
}

export interface TransferCandidate {
  outPlayerId: number;
  inPlayerId: number;
  outTeamId: number;
  inTeamId: number;
  positionId: number;
  estimatedSellPrice: number;
  buyPrice: number;
  estimatedCostDelta: number; // buy - sell
  resultingBank: number | null;
  checks: {
    budgetOk: boolean;
    alreadyOwned: boolean;
    teamLimitOk: boolean;
    positionOk: boolean;
  };
}
