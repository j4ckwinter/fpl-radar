You are working in the repo `fpl-radar`.

Implement Issue #10: Fetch and store entry picks for the current gameweek (squad snapshots) for all entries in a league.

This builds on:
- Issue #7: `FplClient` exists
- Issue #8: reference tables exist (teams/players/positions/gameweeks + snapshot table)
- Issue #9: league + league entries are persisted

## Goal
Given a `leagueId`, fetch each league entry’s picks for a target gameweek and persist a “squad snapshot” that includes:
- the 15 picked players (element ids)
- starting XI vs bench order
- captain/vice captain flags
- entry history values that matter for transfers (bank, value, free transfers if available)
- timestamps for when the snapshot was fetched

The pipeline must:
- handle many entries efficiently (concurrency limit)
- be idempotent (upsert per entry+gameweek)
- tolerate partial failures (continue if 1 entry fails, record error)
- be runnable via a script now, and reusable from the worker later

Do NOT implement prediction logic yet.

## Important API notes
The public endpoint needed:
- `GET /api/entry/{entryId}/event/{eventId}/picks/`

This typically includes:
- `picks[]` with `{ element, position, is_captain, is_vice_captain, multiplier }`
- `entry_history` with values like `bank`, `value`, `event_transfers`, `event_transfers_cost`, etc.
Field names may differ slightly; use Zod to validate only what you need and allow passthrough for unknown fields.

Also:
- Determine `eventId` (gameweek) from `bootstrap-static` events where `is_next` or `is_current` depending on time.
Default behaviour:
- Use `is_next === true` gameweek as “upcoming deadline”
- If none, fall back to `is_current` or latest unfinished
Allow overriding with `FPL_EVENT_ID` env var.

## Deliverables

### A) Prisma schema changes
Add models:

#### 1) `FplEntrySnapshot`
Represents one entry’s squad state for a given gameweek.
Fields:
- `id` String @id @default(cuid())
- `leagueId` Int  (FK -> FplLeague)
- `entryId` Int   (FK -> FplLeagueEntry via id; or keep as scalar if you prefer)
- `eventId` Int   (FK -> FplGameweek)
- `bank` Int?     (tenths; from entry_history.bank)
- `teamValue` Int? (tenths; from entry_history.value)
- `eventTransfers` Int? (optional)
- `eventTransfersCost` Int? (optional)
- `fetchedAt` DateTime @default(now())
- `createdAt` DateTime @default(now())
- `updatedAt` DateTime @updatedAt

Constraints:
- Unique composite: `(leagueId, entryId, eventId)`

Indexes:
- `(leagueId, eventId)`
- `(entryId, eventId)`

#### 2) `FplEntryPick`
Represents the 15 picks belonging to a snapshot.
Fields:
- `id` String @id @default(cuid())
- `snapshotId` String (FK -> FplEntrySnapshot)
- `playerId` Int (FK -> FplPlayer id / FPL element id)
- `pickPosition` Int (1..15 as returned by FPL)
- `multiplier` Int
- `isCaptain` Boolean
- `isViceCaptain` Boolean

Constraints:
- Unique composite: `(snapshotId, pickPosition)`
- Optional: Unique composite `(snapshotId, playerId)` (careful: in rare data bugs duplicates could exist)

Relation:
- Snapshot 1 → many Picks with cascade delete

After schema updates, run:
```bash
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name fpl_entry_snapshots
