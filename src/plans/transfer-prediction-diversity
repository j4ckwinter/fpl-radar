# Transfer prediction diversity (future)

**Context:** Issue #15 transfer probabilities can return many predictions that share the same OUT player (e.g. 15+ “Senesi → X” moves in the top 20), which is noisy for display and may not reflect how many distinct “sell candidates” we want to surface.

**Proposed enhancement:** Add a per–out-player cap when building the final prediction list.

- After scoring and sorting all candidates by score, walk down the list and only add a prediction if that `outPlayerId` has been used fewer than K times so far.
- Stop when we have `maxResults` predictions (e.g. 20) or the list is exhausted.
- Example: `MAX_PREDICTIONS_PER_OUT_PLAYER = 5` so no single out-player fills more than 5 slots in the top N.
- Implement in the “sort by score desc, take top maxResults” step in `predictTransfersForEntry` (or a small helper). Make the limit a constant in `transferPrediction/constants.ts` so it’s tunable.

**Status:** Not implemented; consider when refining transfer prediction UX or reducing dominance of one sell candidate in the list.
