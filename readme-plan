You are working in the repo `fpl-radar`.

Create a high-quality `README.md` for this project. The README should be clear, technical, and professional — suitable for a serious open-source or portfolio-grade backend project.

## Project Context
- `fpl-radar` is a backend engine for Fantasy Premier League analysis.
- The core differentiator is **predicting likely transfers by rivals in a specific mini-league**, based on constraints, behaviour, and form.
- This is not just a stats API — it is a **decision-support system**.
- The backend is designed to support a future frontend (web app), but is currently API- and worker-focused.

## Tone & Style
- Clear, concise, confident
- No hype, no marketing fluff
- Assume the reader is a developer
- Use British English
- Use Markdown headings, bullet points, and code blocks appropriately

## README Structure (must follow this order)

### 1. Title & Short Description
- Project name: `fpl-radar`
- One-paragraph summary explaining *what it does* and *why it exists*
- Emphasise:
  - Rival transfer prediction
  - Mini-league focus
  - Probabilistic / risk-aware insights

### 2. Core Idea (Killer Feature)
Explain, in plain but precise terms:
- The problem: FPL managers don’t know what rivals are likely to do
- The solution: model rival constraints + behaviour to predict likely transfers
- Examples:
  - “Which players are most likely to be sold?”
  - “Which bandwagons are my rivals likely to follow?”
  - “How risky is a differential given what my league might do?”

This section should make it obvious why the project is interesting.

### 3. High-Level Architecture
Describe the system components:
- API service (Fastify)
- Worker service (BullMQ)
- PostgreSQL (Prisma)
- Redis (caching + queues)
- FPL public API as upstream data source

Include a small ASCII-style architecture diagram if helpful (optional, not required).

### 4. Tech Stack
Bullet list:
- Node.js + TypeScript
- Fastify
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Redis + BullMQ
- Zod
- Pino
- Vitest (if present)

Keep it factual.

### 5. Data Flow Overview
Briefly describe:
- Fetching FPL public data
- Persisting reference data (teams, players, gameweeks)
- League ingestion
- Rival analysis & prediction pipeline

This should help a new contributor understand *how data moves* through the system.

### 6. Getting Started (Local Development)
Include:
- Prerequisites (Node version, pnpm, Postgres, Redis)
- Install dependencies
- Environment setup (`.env.example`)
- Running the API
- Running the worker
- Running bootstrap ingestion

Use real commands where possible:
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm ingest:bootstrap`

### 7. Scripts
List key `package.json` scripts with short explanations.

### 8. Current Status
Be explicit:
- Foundations complete
- Reference data ingestion in progress
- Rival prediction engine planned

This sets expectations clearly.

### 9. Roadmap (Short)
Bullet list of upcoming milestones:
- League ingestion
- Rival transfer prediction
- Public API for frontend
- Risk-mode insights

Do not over-promise.

### 10. Non-Goals (Important)
Add a short section clarifying what this project is *not*:
- Not an official FPL API
- Not real-time
- Not guaranteed predictions

This increases credibility.

### 11. License / Disclaimer
- State that this project uses publicly available FPL endpoints
- Add a short disclaimer that it is not affiliated with the Premier League or FPL

## Constraints
- Do not include badges yet
- Do not include screenshots
- Do not include contribution guidelines yet
- Keep the README under ~2–3 pages when rendered
- No emojis

## Output
- Create or overwrite `README.md`
- Ensure Markdown renders cleanly on GitHub
- Use consistent heading levels

Implement this directly in the repo.
